## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I could say i learnt nothing new while working on this project. Well, except for the fact that one could set the color of a certain element to transparent.

### Continued development

Though i did come across a certain issue, while setting the properties of the hover on CSS, I realized it affected the div element as well. I would do futher research and find a way to counter that in future projects.
